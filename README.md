# UCF Coding Bootcamp Challenge One

## Purpose

As a bootcamp student, I am required to complete weekly challenges on the topics covered in the classes of the previous week. I was provided an existing HTML and CSS code for a website for a marketing agency that was functional, but did not follow industry accessibility standards. 

The challenge given to me was to refactor the code in a way that the functionality of the site was not affected, but that accessibility standards were met and the code was organized in a clear manner. I achieved this by adding semantic HTML elements where possible, modifying the code to ensure the elements follow a logical structure that is independent of style and positioning, adding alt text attributes to images to allow for further accessibility, ensuring the heading attributes fall in sequential order, and updating the title element with specific, descriptive title. All of which contributed to a more organized, clear structure of the code.
